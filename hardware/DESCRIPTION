<h1>AVR "ZIFfy" ISP Shield</h1>
<p>Riff on the version(s) from SparkFun, EvilMadScientist, and my own insane ideas while trying to learn to use EAGLE.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Revison 5.0</b> - Instead of using separate ZIF sockets, use a ridiculous 6P4T mechanical switch to select which lines go to which pins. Supports programming any AVR via the ISP connector, and the following via the onboard ZIF socket:
<ul>
<li>ATTiny 25/45/85
<li>ATTiny 24/44/84
<li>ATTiny 2313/4313
<li>ATMega 328P
</ul>

</ul>
