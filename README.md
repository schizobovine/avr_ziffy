=========

Arduino shield with a plethora of ZIF sockets to allow programming of all the
various Atmel AVR chips.

The hardware directory should contain the Eagle CAD project files needed to
build the board. Since they're Not Exactly Code but still open hardware, I'm
licensing them under Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike license.

I've modified the sample code provided with the Arduino distribution for the
firmware files, both because I needed to ensure all the pins would line up and
also do fix a few problems/lack of clarity in the source code Sicne this was
originally under a 2-clause BSD license, I will stick to that for my fork of
the code.
